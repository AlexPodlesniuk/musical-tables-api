What is wrong with this solution?
- violated single responsibility
- violated open-closed
- model is not agnstic. json? bson?
- how easy to add a new feature / how to handle complexity?

Consider future requirements
- add validation logic for:
    1. room management
    2. table management
    3. booking

- when table reservation completed, new booking should be created
- when new booking is created, booking history record is created
- user should be able to cancel booking

- we want to verify our code completely, but with isolation
- we need scalability

- we want to expiremtn with different frameworks, databases, etc
